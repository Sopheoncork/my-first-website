# My very first webpage

Welcome!

READMEs are a great way of describing what your project does without having to use it, or read through the code. 
For example, a potential, but non-technical, employer might look at your GitHub account to see the types of projects
on which you've worked. 

## Challenge:
Add some more content to your Markdown. Give the project a 
full description and include descriptions of the technologies used in this project, 
or what you feel the rationale behind this project.

## Full Description of this Project:
The purpose of this particular project is to learn about **Git** and **GitHub** and how to use same as a repository hosting service. 

I used Cloud9 to write some of my very first code. Cloud9 is an online integrated development environment, published as open source from version 2.0, until version 3.0. It supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, JavaScript with Node.js, and Go.

I then set up a *terminal* and from there I was able to co-ordinate and move my newly made *Git* and set up a new repository in *Github* and move my files there.
